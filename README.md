# Python Functions Lab
In this lab, you’ll get hands-on practice defining and calling functions in Python. By the end, you will be able to:

- Understand and apply Python’s function syntax.
- Return values from functions based on given parameters.
- Manipulate simple data types through function parameters.

        We understand that some of the exercises in this lab may seem very basic or even easy. This simplicity is intentional. The primary goal is to provide ample opportunity to practice writing Python functions. By focusing on repetition, you can become more comfortable with the syntax and mechanics of function definition and calling.

## Getting Started
- For each exercise, copy the provided code into a new Python script file named exercises.py.
- Follow the exercise instructions carefully to complete the function definitions.
- After completing each exercise, run python3 exercises.py in your terminal to test your code and see the output.

Let's dive in and start coding!

## Exercise 1: Calculate Area of a Triangle
```
# Exercise 1: Calculate Area of a Triangle
#
# Write a function named `calculate_area_triangle` that takes the base and height of a triangle and returns the area.
# The area formula is (base * height) / 2.
#
# Examples:
# calculate_area_triangle(10, 5) should return 25.0.
# calculate_area_triangle(7, 3) should return 10.5.
#
# Define your function and call it below.



print('Exercise 1:', calculate_area_triangle(10, 5))
```

## Exercise 2: Calculate Simple Interest
```
# Exercise 2: Calculate Simple Interest
#
# Write a function named `simple_interest` that takes principal, rate of interest (as a percentage), and time (years).
# Calculate and return the simple interest using the formula (principal * rate * time) / 100.
#
# Examples:
# simple_interest(1000, 5, 2) should return 100.
# simple_interest(1500, 3.5, 5) should return 262.5.
#
# Define your function and call it to see the result.



print('Exercise 2:', simple_interest(1000, 5, 2))
```

## Exercise 3: Apply a Discount
```
# Exercise 3: Apply a Discount
#
# Write a function named `apply_discount` that takes a product's price and a discount percentage (from 0 to 100).
# Return the new price after applying the discount.
#
# Examples:
# apply_discount(100, 25) should return 75.
# apply_discount(80, 10) should return 72.
#
# Define your function and call it to display the discounted price.



print('Exercise 3:', apply_discount(100, 25))
```

## Exercise 4: Convert Temperature
```
# Exercise 4: Convert Temperature
#
# Write a function called `convert_temperature` that takes a
# temperature and a unit ('C' for Celsius, 'F' for Fahrenheit)
# and converts the temperature to the other unit.
# The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is (Celsius * 9/5) + 32.
# The formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9.
#
# Examples:
# convert_temperature(0, 'C') should return 32.0.
# convert_temperature(32, 'F') should return 0.0.
#
# Define the function and then call it below.



print('Exercise 4: Convert 0°C to Fahrenheit:', convert_temperature(0, 'C'))
print('Exercise 4: Convert 32°F to Celsius:', convert_temperature(32, 'F'))
```

## Exercise 5: Sum to N
```
# Exercise 5: Sum to N
#
# Write a function named `sum_to` that takes a single integer n and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n.
#
# Examples:
# sum_to(6) should return 21.
# sum_to(10) should return 55.
#
# Define the function and then call it below.



print('Exercise 5:', sum_to(6))
```

## Exercise 6: Find the Largest Number
```
# Exercise 6: Find the Largest Number
#
# Write a function named `largest` that takes three integers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
#
# Examples:
# largest(1, 2, 3) should return 3.
# largest(10, 4, 2) should return 10.
#
# Define your function and test it with different inputs.



print('Exercise 6:', largest(1, 2, 3))
```

## Exercise 7: Calculate a Tip
```
# Exercise 7: Calculate a Tip
#
# Create a function called `calculate_tip`. It should take the bill amount and the tip percentage (as a whole number).
# The function should return the amount of the tip.
#
# Examples:
# calculate_tip(50, 20) should return 10.
#
# Write your function and test its output below.



print('Exercise 7:', calculate_tip(50, 20))
```

## Exercise 8: Calculate Product of Numbers
```
# Exercise 8: Calculate Product of Numbers
#
# Write a function named `product` that takes an arbitrary number of numbers, multiplies them, and returns the product.
# Review your notes on *args for handling an arbitrary number of arguments.
#
# Examples:
# product(-1, 4) should return -4.
# product(2, 5, 5) should return 50.
#
# Define the function and call it with different sets of numbers to test.



print('Exercise 8:', product(2, 5, 5))
```

## Exercise 9: Basic Calculator
```
# Exercise 9: Basic Calculator
#
# Create a function named `basic_calculator` that takes three arguments: 
# two numbers and a string representing an operation ('add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'). 
# Perform the provided operation on the two numbers. In operations where the order of numbers is important, 
# treat the first parameter as the first operand and the second parameter as the second operand.
#
# Examples:
# basic_calculator(10, 5, 'subtract') should return 5.
# basic_calculator(10, 5, 'add') should return 15.
# basic_calculator(10, 5, 'multiply') should return 50.
# basic_calculator(10, 5, 'divide') should return 2.
#
# Define the function and then call it below.



print('Exercise 9 Result:', basic_calculator(10, 5, "subtract"))
```
